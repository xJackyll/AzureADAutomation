Important Note
This project relies on a specific folder and file structure. To ensure proper functionality, DO NOT modify:

Folder & File names.
The Data in the Files (except for the ones mentioned above).
The Structure outlined in the "Project Structure" section.
Any alterations to these elements may lead to unexpected behavior and could compromise the project's functionality.


Note: when a user is in multiple groups that have the same names there's no way for the script to spot the intended one and exiting from the others, so it will leave things as they are.
